# Hi, I’m Ankan 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer (SDE 2)** working at an AI startup in Bangalore.  
I enjoy building **backend systems, distributed architectures, and AI/ML projects** that solve real problems.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- **Federated Learning Playground** – exploring privacy-preserving ML with TensorFlow Federated.  
- **Event-Driven Architectures** – experimenting with Python + Kafka + FastAPI to design resilient systems.  
- **Anomaly Detection Pipeline** – real-time log monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana.  
- **Low-Level Design Projects** – BookMyShow clone, WhatsApp design, feature flag service, and more.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (Node.js), a bit of Java  
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Redis  
- **Infra & Tools**: AWS (Lambda, RDS, S3, CloudFront, ECS), Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana

## 📚 Current Learning
- **Federated Learning** and **Differential Privacy**  
- **Resilient distributed systems**: consensus, partitioning, monitoring  
- **Creative coding side projects**: mixing art + AI  

---

## 📈 GitHub Highlights
- Pinned repos showcase projects on ML, distributed systems, and backend design.  
- I believe in **learning by building** — each repo documents part of my growth as an engineer.

---

## 🌍 Beyond Code
- Passionate about **travel** (road trips, hiking, diving) and **storytelling through code & visuals**.  
- Running an Instagram page — [**Git Dragon**](https://instagram.com/gitdragon) 🐉 — where I share Python tips in <30s reels.
